# Vagrant Quickstart

This folder contains Vagrant code to stand up a single Rancher server instance with a single node cluster attached to it.

## Requirements

- [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com)
- [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org)
- 6GB unused RAM

## Deploy

0. Clone this repository and go into the vagrant subfolder
0. Run `vagrant up`

When provisioning is finished the Rancher UI will become accessible on [192.168.56.101](http://192.168.56.101).
The default password is `adminPassword`, but this can be updated in the config.yaml file (must be at least 12 characters).

If you want to keep the configuration changes outside the git repository you can copy the config.yaml file to local_config.yaml and make changes there.

## Remove

To remove the VMs that have been deployed run `vagrant destroy -f`
